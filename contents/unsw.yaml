      caption: Upper Campus of UNSW
      subcaption: A bit of a trek uphill from the Central to UNSW bus stop, and to be
        honest, I don't really remember having many reasons to come all the way up here.

      caption: Glenfield Station
      subcaption: Living in suburban Sydney affords me many luxuries, one of them not
        being a quick commute. Here I climb aboard a train for my daily hour-long commute
        to the city, getting off at Central station.

      subcaption: The cream of the crop when it comes to Sydney Train's fleet of locomotives.
        Seats are movable, and there are two levels as well as a vestibule. However, you
        aren't always that lucky to get one of these air conditioned bad boys. Sometimes,
        you get stuck with a 1980's era tin-can, complete with no ventilation in 40 degree
        heat.

      caption: University Mall
      subcaption: The main pathway to *almost* all of UNSW, from Anzac Parade to about
        halfway across campus. On the left is Red Centre, which houses both the Math faculty,
        as well as Built Environment. On the right is Webster, which houses the Arts faculty.

      caption: Ainsworth Building
      subcaption: The mechanical engineering building, 5 floors tall, with a cafe on the
        ground floor, as well as a few lecture halls. Level 3 of this building however
        is filled with Computer Science labs, and is unaccessable for mechanical engineering
        students.

      caption: Coffee on Campus
      subcaption: Located on the bottom floor of the Mechanical/Computer Science building,
        Coffee on Campus is the go-to destination for students looking for a quick hit
        of caffeine, before heading back upstairs to hit the books.

      caption: K17 - The Computer Science Building
      subcaption: The actual computer science building, where all the CSE faculty and
        academics do their hard work in. There aren't too many computer science labs here,
        and its a little old, but still gets the job done. Inside you can find the amazing
        CSE student office, working tirelessly to answer many student queries, usually
        about things you can find online anyway, but massive props to them.

      caption: Level 3 of Ainsworth
      subcaption: The only floor of the Mechanical building that was filled with Computer
        Science labs, here is where I spent most of my university contact hours.

      caption: Sitar and Kora
      subcaption: A big part of my university life was tutoring *a lot* of computing courses.
        Most of my memories of uni are in these computer labs, helping students out with
        segmentation faults, misspelt variable names and memory leaks. And of course,
        having plenty of fun.

      caption: Chi
      subcaption: 'Being a tutor gave me exclusive access to the ''Chi'' lab, a lab packed
        to the brim with iMac 21''s. Usually used for UI/UX courses that only run in semester
        2, during semester 1 it''s always got the ragtag team of undergrad tutors. '

      link: https://lens-img-alpha.netlify.app/unsw/13_Globe.jpg
      caption: Globe Lawn
      subcaption: Never really did much here, other than walk through it, but it's defintely
        a nice site. ENGSOC usually do their 'exclusive-to-engineering-students' weekly
        barbeque here, one that I wasn't invited to because I *technically* studied a
        science degree.
    13_Quad.jpg:

      link: https://lens-img-alpha.netlify.app/unsw/13_Quad.jpg
      caption: Quadrangle
      subcaption: One of the weirdest parts of UNSW, mainly because there's really no
        pattern as to how the classrooms are arranged, and their corresponding numbers.
        But, at least there's a cool sundial thing. Never used it though to check the
        time, but nevertheless, very cool.
    15_Law.jpg:
      type: image
      link: https://lens-img-alpha.netlify.app/unsw/15_Law.jpg
      caption: Law Building
      subcaption: Never really had any classes here, but they have nice toilets, and the
        law students get upset when non-law students use their libraries to study.
    16_RedCentre.jpg:
      type: image
      link: https://lens-img-alpha.netlify.app/unsw/16_RedCentre.jpg
      caption: Red Centre
      subcaption: Although my degree was in Computer Science, I still did a couple of
        math courses here and there, for both core and electives, and they were all done
        here. It certainly isn't the nicest building on campus, but how much fancy tech
        gizmos do you really need to teach math?

      link: https://lens-img-alpha.netlify.app/unsw/17_Asian.jpg
      caption: Asian Fusion
      subcaption: One of the few restaurants in Quad, they serve primarily asian food
        (not really fused with anything else). It always got a weekly purchase from me.

      caption: Max Brenner & Guzman
      subcaption: Actual franchises of major restuarant chains are also on campus. Although
        I've only been to Max Brenner once (for this photo actually, you can see some
        of my mates sitting down), Guzman is definitely on the top of the list of what
        restuarants I frequented the most.

      caption: Chemist at Quad
      subcaption: My go-to destination for cheap drinks, and my drink of choice? Coconut
        water. I have no idea how, but the prices on soft / niche Japanese drinks is so
        insanely low, I really don't know how they stay in business. They also sell medicine.

      caption: Grand Concourse at Central Station
      subcaption: End of the day, ready for the hour long journey back home. This here
        is the Grand Concourse, one of many different entrances to Central, but definitely
        the most beautiful.
