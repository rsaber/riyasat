            assortment of pastries.

            land of rear-cleansing toilets and delicious fish. Everyone bows there, a lot.
            Also, they spoke to me in Japanese first, and then upon seeing the complexion
            of my skin, revert to English.

            apartment for a month. It was a short walking distance away from work, and came
            with a small welcome basket, a third of which was alcohol.

          subcaption: The absolute unit of cathedrals, St. Paul's Cathedral is a magnificent
            piece of architecture, and pictures can't describe the feeling of awe you get
            when you look up at it. Although they have a "pay-to-pray" policy, and taking
            photos of the inside is a big no-no.

            this is the closest branch to my work. Definitely has a different vibe to it,
            compared to the large warehouses I was used to back in suburban Sydney.

            are black too. These black ones have WiFi as well, although I've never tried them.
            Also, I wouldn't want to press that telephone against my ear either. Not exactly
            that clean.

            bicycle share docking stations scattered across the city. Odd that the most London
            thing is sponsored by a Spanish bank and named after Boris Johnson.

            the previously demolished building in its courtyard. London tends to want to remember
            it's history.

            court house. Didn't get the chance to go inside, but there are people at the entrance
            protesting various policies, usually human rights related.

            with every country in the Commonwealth (including my homeland, Australia). Not
            open to the general public, this was the only photo I could snap.

          caption: Path to Buckingham
          subcaption: Although there are multiple ways to get to Buckingham Palace, the only
            way to get there by vehicle is through here. There are usually mounted police
            patrolling in this area, as well as the occaisional ceremonious change of the
            guard for the neighbouring buildings closeby. Just imagine well trained British
            soldiers, dressed in funny costumes walking in sync.

          subcaption: Infront of Buckingham Palace are wide arrays of well-maintained gardens.
            Honestly speaking, everything there felt so vibrant, the grass so green, the flowers
            so vivid, it's like someone maxed out the saturation post-production.

          subcaption: The main attraction, it was incredibly difficult to get a good photo.
            The area was packed with tourists, and it was hard to even cross the road. Police
            patrolled the empty roads, whilst tourists looked on from the footpaths, sitting
            on the massive stone fences. I was also scared of someone snatching my phone out
            of my hand, so I didn't take the best photos I could have.

            aligned trees creating a sort of path. Not as packed with tourists, there was
            one small stall that sold icecream and coffee, at the usual overpriced tourist
            prices you would expect.

            Palace, but was relocated to a largely isolated traffic island. It also gives
            it's name to the surrounding area, Marble Arch Station.

          subcaption: Near London Bridge and The Shard, is Borough Markets, one of the oldest
            markets operating in the UK (some dating back to the 12th century). The present
            buildings however are a little newer, built around 1850's. There are plenty of
            stalls selling specialty goods, and you're sure to find something delicious.

            every block.

          subcaption: One neat thing about London, that I haven't seen in other cities is
            the contrast between old and new. There are plenty of brand new, glass covered
            skyscrapers next to centuries old stone cathedrals. And if anything old was torn
            down, there's always a small memorial detailing its fate. London really cares
            about its history.

            people fish in the Thames, and here you can see a couple of blokes fishing under
            London Bridge. It definitely isn't the cleanest river. Still isn't as bad as the
            Ganges, but I would prefer to avoid eating fish caught here.

            of 70,000 of the city's 80,0000 inhabitants, there have only been 6 recorded deaths,
            however that number is disputed due to the intensity of the fire cremating the
            remains of many people.

            the Gherkin, the Shard and Tower Bridge. Don't worry about falling off, theres
            fencing around the whole 'balcony'. It's also awfully narrow, so expect to squeeze
            past other tourists.

          subcaption: The Royal Exchange was founded in the 16th century and used to house
            Lloyds Insurance for 150 years. Nowadays it houses fancy cocktail bars and luxury
            shops. There's also a healthy amount of monuments adorning it's main entrance,
            paying tribute to war heroes who dedicated their lives to England.

            the ancient Roman temple of Mithras. The ruins were recreated and opened as a

          subcaption: As soon as you walk in, you are surrounded by a whirlwind of hardwood,
            a little confusing to walk around in, until you realise there are only two exits,
            and you can't really get that lost.

          subcaption: The main pantry, and one of many of the Bloomberg London office. Located
            on level 6, you get a clear view of St. Paul's Cathedral, as you relax and snack
            away. They don't serve food here everyday, to encourage employees to purchase
            food from neighbouring small businesses.
