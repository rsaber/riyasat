    G'day I'm Riyo - C++ software engineer working in financial technology. I'll write things here that I think are either worth remembering about, or worth reading. 

    I'm also an avid photographer, and I take plenty of photos when I travel and make exciting photoessays journalling my adventures. Although do note that photos posted here are compressed and scaled to save bandwidth. 

    Feel free to shoot me a message at saber(at)riyasat(dot)gmail(dot)com
