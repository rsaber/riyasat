  description: A day trip to the famed university town. Not too long of a train ride out of London, and not too expensive either.

      subcaption: Booked a ticket last minute on trainline on the GWR. Surprisingly affordable,
        and surprisingly empty. The train was equipped with power points at every seat,
        and a very nice bathroom at the nd of each carriage.

      subcaption: Two minutes away from the city centre, the Royal Oxford Hotel has some
        pretty nice and spacious rooms. Being the stingy boy I am, I didn't stay the night,
        so don't expect any photos of the insides.

        lies Christ Church Meadows, a popular picnic and walking spot.

        shot of the River Thames. Kayaking teams can be seen here, training, although
        I have yet to spot a fisherman like I have back in London.

      caption: Mound at Oxford Castle
      subcaption: Apparently an entirely man made endeavour, the Mound is a somewhat tall,
        well, mound. Costing a mere 3 quid to get in, the climb was not steep, nor tiring.
        It's just a mound I guess?

      subcaption: A steep climb up a narrow set of stairs (so narrow that only one person
        can fit in), Carfax Tower gives an amazing view of the Oxford city centre. It's
        all that remains of a 12th century Church, and for a fair part of its life, was
        the official church of Oxford.

        to tourists, I head back to Christ Church, pay up (because this is the UK, where
        nothing is free).

        wide enough to fit a single person, I'm presented with a beautiful view of the
        city.

        for "room"), is a neo classical piece of architecture from the late 1700's. Funded
        with the estate of a John Radcliffe, it hosts a wide range of scientific literature.
